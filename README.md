 # Advanced Fisheries Economics Workshop February 5 - March 5 2021

Links to materials can be found here along with further instructions.

## Preparation

We will be using Jupyter notebooks and Python. 

The first-step is to click on the link at right and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

Download and install the Python 3.7 version. You will need administrator rights on your computer to do this.

Also have a look at [Google Collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (you will need a [gmail account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp) to access this).

We will use [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for  classroom presentation and discussion, you will need to sign up for an account and downlaod the software. In addition to participate and receive assistance if you get stuck on something we will use [AnyDesk](https://anydesk.com/en). You will need to download and install this by following the instructions as they appear. AnyDesk will allow me to monitor your indiviual progress and assist you if you appear not to understand something or are falling behind.

## Philosophy

The approach we take is informed by a number of ideas, the first is that the practice of economics is largely a form of computation, the second it that analyses should be reproducible ([reproducible research](https://reproducibleresearch.net/)) and the third that when reporting the results of analyses, the emphasis should be on the written word rather than the computation ([literate programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com/)). Finally, the approach should be participative in the tradition of [R.L. Moore's approach to teaching mathematics](http://www.legacyrlmoore.org/).

## Background

I recommend Preston McAfee's [Introduction to economic analysis](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/25025/2/MCAiea200.pdf) as background reading on general economics. Chapter 6 section 6 is on fisheries.

[National and regional fisheries economics workshop interactive tutorials](https://ffa-econ.shinyapps.io/econworkshop/) are also useful background.

## References 

Arne Eide's [Introduction to Fisheries Economics](https://figshare.com/articles/Introduction_to_Fisheries_Economics/3784821#)
is a good reference. It uses Wolfram Language (Mathematica) for the exercises which is an alternative but less online support and help available. So we will use Python instead. [Google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=174&date=all&q=%2Fm%2F05z1_,Mathematica,Excel,R,Julia%20programming%20language) partially answers why Python is a good choice.

## Exercises

Exercises will be completed in Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are interactive mathematical notebooks that are based on the idea of literate programming, where the words and comments are just as important as writing computer code. Think of them as like Word documents that can do calculations and plot graphs.
